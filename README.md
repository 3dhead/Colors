Type the name of a color to make it so. Perfect for three-year-olds:

Yup. Just type a color name. (Or at least, one of the supported color names. I went for curation and simplicity here rather than infinite messiness. Say what you will.) The letters all appear as capitals since that’s what the little ones learn first—and that matches most keyboard keys. As soon as a color name is typed the background color will change appropriately. So fullscreen it, pull up your three-year-old, and give `RED` a shot since it’s a nice and short one with a vibrant pay off.
